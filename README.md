# jQuery pageSwipe

This is a jQuery plugin in progress that lets you create an e-reader or iPad
magazine-like user experience for your web app.

## Testing with the iOS Simuator on Mac OS X

The iOS Simulator on the newest XCode has to be manually installed and is
located at:

```
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/iPhone Simulator.app
```

To open the demo in the iOS Simulator, a config.ru file is provided in this
recipe. This way you can open up a local web server to access the demo in the
simulator:

``` sh
gem install rack
cd jquery-pageswipe
rackup -p 3000
```
